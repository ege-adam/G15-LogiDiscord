# G15-LogiDiscord
A WIP Discord status display / controller application for Logitech G15 keyboards

This app is highly experimental. Since Discord RPC is not well documented, and always changing; this app is not well coded and will be changed accordingly.
Currently no pre-build binaries. I will upload pre-build binaries after adding "Reading Client-ID/Client-Secret from file" functionality.

To make mute / deafen buttons work:
You have to add "LControl + LShift + Numpad *" as "Mute toggle" shortcut in Discord.
You have to add "LControl + LShift + Numpad -" as "Deafen toggle" shortcut in Discord.
Since in Discord RPC mute/deafen not working stabile.
